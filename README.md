# Description

This particular project uses SQL in the backend and C++ as frontend. Not a very ideal solution but works.

There are 2 files-
  v1 and v6 (version1 and 6 respectively)
  v1 is just a trial v6 is final
  
Main.cpp is the file to run 
For sql connectivity just one extra file mysql.h need to be included in the header file folder to import it easily

Database need to be created with proposed schema using either of SQL server provider software
